  <h3> My first five years </h3>
  <p> I was born in <b> Miami, Florida </b>. I lived with 2 brothers, one sister and a dog. This all occured over <i> fourteen years </i> ago. I advise people to visit <a href="https://www.miamiandbeaches.com" >  Miami  </a> soon! </p>

  <h3> Elementary School </h3>
  <p> For my elementary years i went to a school in Miami called Sunset Elementary. I went there for <b> first to fifth grade </b>. I was a very good school. I am a second generation <i> Sunset Alum </i> because my dad went there to. I suggest you look into <a href="https://sunsetinternationalschool.com">Sunset Elementary </a>. </p>
